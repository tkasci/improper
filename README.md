# improper - an R package for improper linear models

Fork from [twolodszko/improper](https://github.com/twolodzko/improper) because the predict methods of the original were broken and the package was not avtively developed anymore.

To install the package: `devtools::install_github("tkasci/improper")`

What you can do with this package:

* estimate improper linear models
* estimate improper GLMs, which includes all families the default `glm()` supports

For details, see the package documentation.
